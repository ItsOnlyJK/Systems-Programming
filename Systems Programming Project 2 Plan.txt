(Files Array internal design)
HASH,  SIZE,  COUNT

1ab,   10,    2 
1ad,   35,    1
34d,   20,    1
8b9,   69420, 6


(System for duplicate file detection and storage)
1. Iterate through database, locate file, retrieve hash and size 
2. Iterate throuhg files array
	a) If hash does match	 --> increase count by 1
	b) If hash doesn't match --> add hash and size to array, set count to 1
3. Repeat...


(System for output production)
Total # of files = SUM(COUNT)
Total # of bytes = SUM(SIZE*COUNT)
Total # of unique file = SUM(COUNT = 1)
Total # of unique bytes = SUM(SIZE)
